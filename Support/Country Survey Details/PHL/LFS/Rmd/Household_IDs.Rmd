This document describes how household IDs are handled across all survey
years.

## Overview

As with all GLD surveys, the data should be uniquely identifiable with
the Household ID variable `hhid` and the Individual ID variable `pid`.
The `pid` is only uniquely identifiable within the household -- not
globally in the survey.

The Philippine LFS survey provides a unique household
identifier/variable in rounds starting in 2004. For these years, that
variable is used to contsruct `hhid`. For years prior to 2008, there is
no given household identifier so one must be constructed.

## Table of Missing HHID variables in data

For all years prior to 2008, at least one round lacks an as-is household
ID variable. Manual HHID construction will occur for these rounds with
missing HHID variables.

## Years 1997 - 2007: Constructing a unique Household ID

The constructed Household ID must satisfy at least two primary
conditions:

1.  The household groupings it produces should be at least descriptively
    reflected in the PSA publications

2.  The Household ID, along with the given line number variable, should
    uniquely identify all observations, minus obvious duplicates.

The following table gives a list of the variable combinations used to
determine unique household IDs in each year and the resulting number of
households that combination generates if/once duplicates are removed.

### Note on 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2007

The first two rounds of 2003 differ from the final two: while the first
two rounds' household ID can be identified similarly to those in
previous years, the final two rounds of 2003 do not have the typical
geographic variables and need to use a different determining set. The
case is similar for 2004: the final round does not have a single, unique
household ID variable and so one must be constructed for the entire
four-round year. Years 2006 and 2007 present similar situations.

## Notes on 2012

2012 does not have a valid, non-missing line number variable that is
present on all observations across all years, so in this year I will
generate a "line number" variable myself by using the row number within
each household grouping.

## Notes on 2017

Even though 2017 does have a household ID variable provided in all 4
rounds, this varible does not uniquely identify observations along with
the line number and round variables. Instead it produces many
duplicates, so a HHID will be constructed.

## Household Heads

Constructing the household IDs in this way produces virtually clean data
on head-of-household. The few exceptions to this are below, where in
every single case there is simply no household head declared. The
harmonizer decided to leave the data as-is, given the extremely few
cases where there is not exactly 1 household head per household and the
inherent problems in declaring a head at random, which is quite
difficult to "undo" from the user's perspective. The GLD user can always
declare a household head in these few scenarios if desired.
