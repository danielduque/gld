# Weights and PSA Checks

Lightweight manual checks to ensure that final appended weight variables
and Labor Force Participation measures align with figures in PSA
publications.

## Weight Variables

This table clarifies the raw weight variable that is used in GLD in
order to emulate the closest results possible to those from the PSA.
Year years 1998-2001 only include one data file. All raw weight
variables are appended into `wgt` in the GLD final dataset.

## Expanded Population + Labor Force Participation by Year

This table gives the expanded population for the appended, four-round
dataset for the entire year. It should generally reflect the population
of the Philippines at that time, but for some years it does not. All
effort has been made to ensure that the raw, incoming weight data has
been coded appropriately. All numbers are reported in millions
(1,000,000) of people ages 15 and over (inclusive). The Annual PSA
reports are only available starting in 2016.

The weight variable provided appears to match published ratios from the
PSA (table below) and has passed our internal quality checks, which
include cross-comparison with the World Development Indicators' data for
raw expanded population. However, it appears that while all survey
years' weight variables are valid for determining ratio such as Labor
Force Participation, etc, the weight variables prior to survey year 2008
are not suitable for determining raw expanded population. With no
obvious way to scale these earlier weight variables, and with
corroborating LFP figures, we're providing the weight variables as-is.

## Labor Force Participation

This table gives select year-round labor force participation figures
from our final datasets and from the PSA's publication. Note that only
relevant observations were included in our datasets for analysis --
e.g., only Janurary/round 1 observations when comparing to the PSA's
January publication for that year. Labor Force Participation includes
the percent of observations who report as employed or unemployed; it
excludes those who are not in the labor force.

The GLD Figures can be obtained on any final year dataset with the
following command in Stata, or by running the `weights_util.do` script
available on the repository.

```{stata}
tab lstatus [aw=wgt]            ///
	  if  age     >= lb_mod_age  ///
	  &   month   == 4          // substitute the correct numerical month (1-12)
```
