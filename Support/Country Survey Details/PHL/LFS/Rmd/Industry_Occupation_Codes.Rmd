# Industry and Occupation Codes

This document provides a brief overview of the industry coding and
occupation coding in GLD. Note that the information is only recorded for
individuals who, because of age minimums in each survey, have been
included in the labor module.

## Industry Codes

### GLD Classification and Coding

The codes for the industry classification of the main job,
`industrycat10`, are given here based on the UN International Standard
Industrial Classification (revision 3). The main categories subsume the
following codes:

| Value | Category Description                      | UN ISCIC Category Values |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1     | Agriculture, Hunting, Fishing             | 01-05                    |
| 2     | Mining                                    | 10-14                    |
| 3     | Manufacturing                             | 15-37                    |
| 4     | Electricity and Utilities                 | 40-41                    |
| 5     | Construction                              | 45                       |
| 6     | Commerce                                  | 50-55                    |
| 7     | Transportation, Storage and Communication | 60-64                    |
| 8     | Financial, Insurance and Real Estate      | 65-74                    |
| 9     | Services: Public Administration\*         | 75                       |
| 10    | Other Services, Unspecified               | 80 -99                   |

\*Note: Public Administration includes the administration of public
services, but direct employment in public services themselves (e.g.
education) is categorized in "Other Services".

### Schemas Covered in Raw Data

The raw data naturally spans different categorization schemes over time.
Principally, there are the 1994 PSCIC and the [2009
PSCIC](http://psa.gov.ph/content/philippine-standard-industrial-classification-psic);
the latter went into effect in January 2012. Since these codes are
available on the PSA website and are quite detailed, a the most useful
overview here is a short table that summarizes the changes in the
metadata. A detailed version of this table, along with individual
labels, can be found by running `label_tools.R`.

For many years, the data arrive in two-digit granularity so the variable
`industry_isic` cannot be constructed, which requires four digits. Other
variables like `industrycat10` can be still be made with the two-digit
data.

| scheme | PSCIC | ISIC Version | Years Applicable | Characteristics                                                                                                   | Coding methodology                                 |
|--------|-------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | 1994  | 3.1          | 97-00            | First digit nearly always aligns with GLD desired code, but not exactly                                           | `floor([var]/10)` then adjust by case              |
| 2      | 1994  | 3.1          | 01-11            | Departure from first-digit pattern, vals range from 1-99                                                          | `gen industry1 = .` then manually replace          |
| 3      | 2009  | 4            | 12,13            | Values range from 100 - 9999, first 2 digits usually correspond to key level                                      | code manually by ranges                            |
| 4      | 2009  | 4            | 14,15,16         | Values range from 1-99 but first two digits correspond to same first two in scheme\#3                             | `gen industry1 = .` then manually replace          |
| 5      | 2009  | 4            | 2017             | Mix of schemas 3 and 4 depending on month/round                                                                   | code with block conditionals on survey month/round |
| 6      | 2009  | 4            | 2018, 2019       | \~5% Labeled, values range from 1-99, like schema 2;4. first two digits correspond to same first two in scheme\#3 | `gen industry1 = .` then manually replace          |

## Occupation Codes

### GLD Classification and Coding

The classification for GLD's occupation classification, `occup` is based
on the [International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO)
88](https://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco88/publ4.htm).
In the case of different classifications re-coding has been done to best
match the ISCO-88.

| value | Category Description                               |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Managers                                           |
| 2     | Professionals                                      |
| 3     | Technicians and associate professionals            |
| 4     | Clerical support workers                           |
| 5     | Service and sales workers                          |
| 6     | Skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers |
| 7     | Craft and related trades workers                   |
| 8     | Plant and machine operators, and assemblers        |
| 9     | Elementary occupations                             |
| 10    | Armed forces occupations                           |
| 99    | Other/unspecified                                  |

### Schemas Covered in Raw Data

As with Industry Codes, the Occupation Codes span different
categorization schemas over time also. Our data spans the PSA's 1992
PSOC and 2012 PSOC Codes. The 2012 PSOC states that the 2012 system was
modeled after the 2008 ISCO revision. The first survey that used the
2012 PSOC codes was the April 2016 LFS survey, according to the [PSA's
technical
note](https://psa.gov.ph/content/technical-notes-labor-force-survey-lfs).
This means that the year 2016 spans two different codification systems.

We can confirm that the codification systems likely changes in the April
2016 round when they are designed to do so because of the differences in
upper numeric limits between the two rounds. The data under the 1992
schema usually ends at `93` while the data under the 2012 schema ends at
`96`, which is reflected in the 2012 PSOC codebook as well.

| scheme | PSOC | ISCO Version | Years Applicable   | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                           | Coding methodology                                         |
|--------|------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | 1992 | ISCO-88      | 97-99,00           | String encoded, mostly numeric data. 2-digit. First digit generally corresponds to major category of ISCO-88.                                                                                             | `floor([numeric variable version]/10)` then adjust by case |
| 2      | 1992 | ISCO-88      | 01-11, 14,15,Jan16 | same as scheme1, but encoded as numeric directly. 2-digit, upper limit of `93`. First digit generally corresponds to major category of ISCO-88.                                                           | `floor([var]/10)` then adjust by case                      |
| 3      | 1992 | ISCO-88      | 12,13              | same as scheme2, but 4-digit. First digit generally corresponds to major category of ISCO-88. The 4-digit codes are simply the lowest-level specificity for each profession in the same 1992 PSOC schema. | `floor([var]/1000)` then adjust by case                    |
| 4      | 2012 | ISCO-08      | April16-2019       | 2-digit, upper limit of `96`. First digit generally corresponds to to major category of ISCO-88.                                                                                                          | `floor([var]/10)` then adjust by cas                       |

### Occupation Codes: Special Cases

#### 1997

The occupation codes in 1997 are encoded as string. Most values are
actually numbers but are simply encoded as characters; in these cases,
the numeric value is extracted from the string and processed further.
There are a few alpha values, but the 1992 PSOC codebook doesn't give
any clear indication as to what these might correspond. Thus, these
alpha values have been left as missing.

Also, there are some numeric values that appear in the data that do not
correspond to codes in the 1992 PSOC codebook. These values have been
coded as "Other" in our data.

#### 2007, 2017

In 2017, the April round has data values under a 4-digit classification
scheme, but all other rounds/months are under a 2-digit classification
scheme. For this year, the coding will occur conditionally based on the
round. This also occurs for the January 2007 round.

#### 2016

Similarly to the cases above, the occupation variable will be coded
conditionally based on the round: January will receive one coding based
on the 1992 PSOC and the rest of the rounds will be coded based on the
2012 PSOC.

##### For the occup_isco variable

Normally, a 2-digit conversion would be provided like this:

1.  convert each PSOC schema to the ISCO equivalent

    > (Wave1) 1992 PSOC -\> 1988 ISCO
    >
    > (Wave2-4) 2012 ISCO -\> 2008 ISCO

2.  Conversion 2: convert all ISCO revisions to ISCO 2008

However, wave1 conversion cannot be done because we do not have a
PSOC-\> ISCO conversion table.Therefore, the data for wave 1 will be
left as missing.

## New Features in GLD Database

The harmonizers working with GLD have made a great effort to reconcile
each country's unique Industry and Occupation codes with an
international code equivalent. This allows for easier cross-country
analysis and for tracking the same indicator within-country over time,
among other benefits.

However, the mechanics to achieve this -- which required a combination
of automation and human oversight -- varied depending on country
context. In the case of the Philippines, the PSA provides publicly their
version of ISIC (PSIC) and ISCO (PSOC) which list that schema's code and
ISIC or ISCO equivalent.
