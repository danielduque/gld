Introduction to the Mexican Labour Force Survey (ENOE)
================

## What is the MEX ENOE?

The Mexican Labour Force and Unemployment Survey (ENOE) is the Mexican Labour Force Survey run as part of Mexico’s National Surveys series from 2005 to 2020.

## What does the MEX ENOE cover?

The Mexican ENOE is a labour force survey collecting information on demographic details (age, sex, location), education (academic), social security, labour market activities over the past quarter, as well as time use and activities over the previous 7 days. The years and sample size of ENOE harmonized for GLD are:

| Year	| # of Households	| # of Individuals	|
| :-------	| :--------		| :--------	 	|
| 2005	| 100,776	| 402,186	|
| 2006	| 104,857	| 411,737	|
| 2007	| 105,567	| 410,185	|
| 2008	| 104,113	| 402,253	|
| 2009	| 102,068	| 392,497	|
| 2010	| 102,489	| 392,674	|
| 2011	| 102,588	| 389,038	|
| 2012	| 102,963	| 388,114	|
| 2013	| 101,382	| 379,010	|
| 2014	| 103,998	| 389,926	|
| 2015	| 105,628	| 390,565	|
| 2016	| 104,809	| 383,381	|
| 2017	| 104,558	| 377,929 |
| 2018	| 104,348	| 375,481 |
| 2019	| 109,335	| 390,018 |
| 2020	| 113,634	| 400,971 |

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata is free and publicly available on the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). INEGI created a [dedicated website](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/enoe/15ymas/#Microdatos) that records ENOE and all previous versions, besides it contains complete information to understand the framework of the ENOE. Data from 2019 onwards can only be circulated within the World Bank. For further information kindly get in touch with the World Bank Jobs Group. 

## What is the sampling procedure?

The ENOE uses a stratified two-stage design. The introductory section of ENOE provides ample detail on the breakdown and goals of the process. Below we share a sequence of images that will allow the user to access the information in the ENOE webpage. The text is in Spanish. Yet, we did a short summary in english at the bottom of this section to give the user a general idea of the information.

[Summarized Translation from the original version]

    The sampling is probabilistic, two-stage, stratified by conglomerates.

    Observation unit: The House.
    Sampling unit: The private home.
    Analysis unit: The home and the residents of the dwelling. [...]

    Sampling frame : The sampling frame used for the ENOE is INEGI's 2012 National Housing Framework, built from the cartographic and demographic information obtained during the 2010 Population and Housing Census, which is updated with each new census survey. [...]

## What is the geographic significance level?

The results are at national, state, and *cities of interest* levels as well as for certain size categories of localities. The cities of interest and sizes of cities, however, may vary over time. It is thus important to check the individual methodology reports. The information on the 2019 ENOE can be found under section 3.3 (page 39/40) of [that year's report](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/biblioteca/ficha.html?upc=702825190613).

## Other Noteworthy Aspects 

### Evolution of the ENOE questionnaires

In the past fifteen years, the Mexican national statistics institute
(INEGI) published five updates (Table 1) of the labor force questionnaire or
ENOE. The ENOE has two versions: the extended version and the basic
version. Every quarter, the INEGI conducts labor surveys using either
version.

### Information used in the GLD harmonization

Since ENOE reports quarterly results using different questionnaires, the 
harmonization team choose between annualizing quarterly results or choosing 
one quarter with mostly similar questionnaire questions. The fact that there 
is no unique questionnaire for the entire year introduces seasonality in 
the input, which could impact the process of data analysis for the user.

Annualizing data means that the results from extended and basic version 
questionnaires would merge which may cause lose of information. In table 2. 
the team summarized the list of absent topics in the extended and 
the basic questionnaire versions.

| Extended Version                                                                               | Basic Version                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Questions about situation after losing a job and the length of unemployment or job inactivity. | Questions about migration and additional labor opportunities (second job).                                                       |
|                                                                                                | Questions on financial, social and economic support such as syndicate enrollment, public social welfare benefits, and insurance. |

### ISIC mapping (MEX)

The Mexican INEGI codes industry in the ENOE based on the Mexican version of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). This system is very different from the international ISIC format. To map from NAICS to ISIC (versions 3.1 and 4), and to code `industrycat_isic`, a special procedure is needed. This process is detailed in a [separate document, available here](../Country%20Survey%20Details/MEX/ENOE/Correspondence_NAICS_ISIC.md).

Questionnaires](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/enoe/15ymas/)

After analyzing the questionnaire versions, the team concluded that using 
quarterly questionnaires data reduces seasonality because INEGI collected quarter one 
data across the years using the extended version. The only exception 
is quarter one data for years 2007 and 2008.

The INEGI compiled comprehensive information on the questionnaires. For instance, methodology of the process for the most [recent version](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/biblioteca/ficha.html?upc=702825190613), and [previous versions](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/biblioteca/ficha.html?upc=702825190613). Similarly, the user can use the [interviewer manuals](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/biblioteca/ficha.html?upc=702825006555) to follow the perspective of the surveyors in [the basic](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/biblioteca/ficha.html?upc=702825006554) and other versions.
