## What is the CHL CASEN?

The CASEN is a chilean household surevey that contains sections for employment, education, dwelling and income. The CASEN has been rolling since 1987 until 2017, yet the GLD project harmonized surveys between 1992 and 2017.  

## What does the CHL CASEN cover?

The CHL CASEN includes one labour section that collects information on employment situations of individuals surveyed. It further provides insights in the reasons for taking or not taking a job and the salary situation of the participant. In addition, other sections of CASEN cover demographic details (age, sex, location), education (academic), social security, labour market activities over the past week, as well as working hours and type of economic activities engaged. The years and sample size of CASEN harmonized for GLD are:

| Year	| # of Households	| # of Individuals	|
| :-------	| :--------		| :--------	 	|
| 1990	| ?         | ?     	|
| 1992	| 35,948	| 143,459	|
| 1994	| 45,379	| 178,057	|
| 1996	| 33,636	| 134,262	|
| 1998	| 48,107	| 188,360	|
| 2000	| 65,036	| 252,748	|
| 2003	| 68,153	| 257,077	|
| 2006	| 73,720    | 268,873   |
| 2009	| 71,460    | 246,924 	|
| 2011	| ?         | ?         |
| 2013	| 66,725    | 218,491   |
| 2015	| 83,887    | 266,968   |
| 2017	| 70,948    | 216,439	|

Note : 1990 was originally part of the harmonized files

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata is free and publicly available on the Ministry of Social Development website. The ministry created a [dedicated website](http://observatorio.ministeriodesarrollosocial.gob.cl/encuesta-casen) that records the results from CASEN, besides it contains complete information to understand the framework of the CASEN. For further information kindly get in touch with the World Bank Jobs Group. 

## What is the sampling procedure?

The ENOE uses a stratified two-stage design. The introductory section of documents from CASEN provides details on the breakdown and goals of the process. The text is in Spanish. Yet, we did a short summary in english to give the user a general idea of the information.  

| Year	|  Description |
| :-------	| :--------		| 
| 1990 - 1994| stratified and random  | 
| 1996 | stratified (geographic with limited stratum), probabilistic, by conglomarates  | 
| 1998 | stratified, probabilistic, by conglomarates,  |
| 2000-2003 | The type of sampling is stratified, by conglomerates and multistage. In each stratum, an independent sample was obtained to represent it, and the set of all of them represents the country.|
| 2006-2009 |the type of sampling is stratified, by compact conglomerates (housing block) and multi-stage.|
| 2011-2017 | probabilistic sample, stratified geographically and by population size, both in urban and rural areas. The selection of the sample is carried out in two or three stages in urban and rural areas.|

## What is the geographic significance level?

The results are at national, rural, urban, regional, and *cities of interest* levels as well as selected communities. The cities of interest and sizes of cities, however, may vary over time. It is thus important to check the individual methodology reports. The information on the 2017 CASEN can be found under section I1.4 (page 10/191) of [that year's report](http://observatorio.ministeriodesarrollosocial.gob.cl/storage/docs/casen/2017/Diseno_Muestral_Casen_2017_MDS.pdf#page10).

## Other Noteworthy Aspects 

### Information used in the GLD harmonization

### Coding of industry and occupation codes
